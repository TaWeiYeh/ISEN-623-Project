In trajectory optimization, I want to compare the computation speed between Differential Dynamic Programming and Sequential Quadratic Programming. 

In trajectory optimization, there are two prevalent optimizers which is Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) and Sequential Quadratic Programming.  I want to compare the computation speed between the two optimizer. DDP is implemented by Zhaoming Xie in their paper, Differential Dynamic Programming with Nonlinear Constraints (https://github.com/ZhaomingXie/CDDP/tree/master). SQP would be implemented using SciPy package.
